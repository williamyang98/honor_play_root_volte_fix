# Unlocking bootloader (Paid)
{: .no_toc }

The bootloader needs to be unlocked to access fastboot to flash custom images to our phone's partitions. However Huawei/Honor has discontinued providing bootloader unlock codes meaning that we need to use unofficial methods.

The method which I used and know works requires two things:
1. Physical access to mainboard to ground a testpoint to access a factory testpoint mode.
2. A **paid** unlock tool which can get the bootloader unlock code while the phone is in testpoint mode.

The unlock tool is around **â‚¬19** and as far as I know there is not another alternative. It also **only lasts for 72 hours** meaning you will need to be **prepared and have free time** before you decide to go through with this.
