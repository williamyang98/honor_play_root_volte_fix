# HCU Unlocker

> **IMPORTANT:** This is a **paid** tool which gives a **limited timed** license to use a properietary non open source tool. I cannot guarantee that this is safe or work for you but I can say that it has worked for me.

The above steps are based on the [provided tutorial]({{ site.data.links.hcu_unlocker.tutorial_read }}) from HCU unlocker. If my steps are too confusing then following the official tutorial.

## 1. Download HCU Unlocker
- Downloaded from [HCU Client]({{ site.data.links.hcu_unlocker.download }})
- [Link (Backup)]({{ "/assets/files/hcu_unlocker_0382.zip" | relative_url }})

## 2. Purchase a 72 hour license
![Payment screen]({{ "/assets/images/hcu_unlocker_payment.png" | relative_url }})
1. Purchase a ```DC-Phoenix + HCU timed license``` for ```â‚¬19.00``` [here]({{ site.data.links.dc_unlocker.purchase }}).
2. You will get a username and password pair which you can then use to login to the ```HCU unlocker```.

## 3. Login to HCU unlocker
![Login screen]({{ "/assets/images/hcu_unlocker_login.png" | relative_url }})
1. Login with your username and password pair. **Once you start you will only have 72 hours to get read your code so make absolutely sure that you are prepared to go through with this**.

## 4. Select CPU loader
![CPU loader]({{ "/assets/images/hcu_unlocker_loader.png" | relative_url }})
1. (Optional) Check in device manager if ```Huawei USB COM 1.0``` is present before starting. If it isn't activate your phone in testpoint mode again. You may need to do this multiple times.
2. Select ```Fastboot/Xloader (Hisilicon only)``` while your Honor Play is in testpoint mode 
  - ```Manufacture mode - COM ports``` doesn't work for the Honor play since it uses the Kirin 970 and is using hardware testpoint mode.
3. Select a CPU loader for the ```Kirin 970``` from the menu. There are multiple options (5 for me) where only one of them will work.
4. Click ```Read phone info```. If it fails move onto the next option until it works.
  - Make sure that your phone is in hardware testpoint mode via device manager.
  - Make sure that you are using the correct driver (I had to use Driver 1 since Driver 2 did not work for me).

### My results with CPU loaders
- Honor Play COR-L29 9.1.0.399 (C636E3R1P12T8)
- You might get different results to me.

| Name | Working |
| --- | --- |
| Kirin 970 8.0 V1 | No |
| Kirin 970 8.0 V2 | No |
| Kirin 970 8.0 V3 | Yes |
| Kirin 970 8.1 V4 | No |
| Kirin 970 8.1 V6 | No |

## 5. Read bootloader unlock code
1. Hopefully if it there is a working CPU loader you will get a success message on the right panel.
2. Enable the checkbox ```Write bootloader code``` without changing any other fields.
3. Click on ```Repair```.
4. Get the bootloader code from the phone information shown in the right hand panel.
  - Refer to the below snippet from my own read attempt as to what you should expect.
  - Refer to the tutorial linked at the head of this page for the official steps.
5. Copy your bootloader code somewhere (it should be a 16 long alphanumeric code).

```
