## Bootloader unlocker
- [PotatoNV]({{ site.data.links.potato_nv.homepage }}) does not work since the Honor Play has the Kirin 970 which is unsupported.
- [HCU Client]({{ site.data.links.hcu_unlocker.download }}) was the recommended paid alternative from [PotatoNV]({{ site.data.links.potato_nv.homepage }}) mentioned in their Github page.
