# Rooting stock image
{: .no_toc }

There are no custom images for the Honor Play so there is no point in using TWRP custom recovery. Instead we will be patching the stock ```recovery_ramdisk.img``` partition with [Magisk]({{ site.data.links.magisk.homepage }}).

I'll be providing the ```recovery_ramdisk_magisk.img``` that I created for my phone. However if this doesn't I will also be providing instructions on how you can create your own ```recovery_ramdisk_magisk.img```. However depending on whether the free link works you may have to use the paid link. This costs around $1.50 USD.
