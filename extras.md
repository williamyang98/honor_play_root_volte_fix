# Extras
Now that we have Magisk installed and have superuser we can do extra things to improve our experience. Unfortunately there are no custom ROMs so our experience is probably going to be limited to installed apps that leverage root permissions, or Magisk modules.

## 1. Install Adaway.

![Settings](/assets/images/adaway_settings.jpg)
![Modules](/assets/images/adaway_modules.jpg)

1. Open Magisk and enable ```Systemless Hosts``` in settings.
2. Reboot phone and check if module is active afterwards.
3. Download the [Adaway]({{ site.data.links.adaway.homepage }}) apk
  - [Link (Backup)](/assets/files/AdAway-6.1.3-20240706.apk)
  - [Link (Github)]({{ site.data.links.adaway.link }})
4. Install Adaway (requires permissions to install external APKs).
5. Open Adaway and grant root permissions from Magisk popup.
